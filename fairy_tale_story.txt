The Magic Lamp in the Forest

Scene 1: A Forest Encounter
In a lush forest, a little girl named Lily gets lost while picking wildflowers. As the sun sets and the forest grows dim, she looks around nervously. Suddenly, a glowing golden lamp floats out from the bushes, radiating warmth as if guiding her. Curious, Lily follows the light deeper into the forest.

Scene 2: The Secret of the Magic Lamp
The lamp stops in front of an ancient tree with a glowing door in its trunk. Lily gently pushes it open and enters a cave sparkling with colorful lights. Inside, a talking fox greets her, explaining that the lamp is the forest’s guardian and can grant one pure wish. Lily thinks for a moment and says, “I want all the animals in the forest to be happy!”

Scene 3: The Forest Feast
The magic lamp emits a dazzling glow, illuminating the entire forest. Animals from all corners—rabbits, squirrels, deer, and birds—gather together, laughing and dancing. Rainbow-colored flowers bloom, and streams sing cheerful tunes, turning the forest into a joyful paradise. Lily joins the animals, sharing fruits and playing games, their laughter echoing through the night.

Scene 4: The Way Home
As night deepens, the magic lamp floats back to Lily’s side, transforming into a star to guide her home. The animals wave goodbye reluctantly, gifting her a flower that never wilts. Lily returns home, lies in bed with the flower in her hands, and smiles contentedly. Outside, the star that was once the lamp twinkles in the night sky.

Scene 5: Epilogue
The next morning, Lily wakes to find the flower still glowing in her hands. She runs to the window and sees a rainbow rising from the forest’s direction. She knows the magic lamp and the forest animals will always be her friends. Voiceover: “As long as kindness lives in your heart, magic will always be there.”
