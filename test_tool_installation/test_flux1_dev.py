# prompt = "The ancient Heart Tree pulses with golden light as its bark repairs itself. The forest spirit dances joyfully while the hedgehog naps contentedly on roots.

# prompt += "Top-left, Standing at the entrance of a vibrant forest with towering trees and sparkling vines, the boy points eagerly down a glowing path, his body leaning forward with curiosity. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting colorful patterns on the ground."
# prompt += "Top-middle, Crouching on a mossy rock beside a winding path, the boy listens intently to a fluffy squirrel perched on a low branch, gesturing animatedly. The forest around them is lush, with oversized flowers and tiny glowing fireflies. "
# prompt += "Top-right, Gripping the ropes of a rickety wooden bridge, the boy takes a cautious step forward, glancing nervously at the bubbling stream below. The forest on both sides is dense, with vines dangling and mist rising from the water. "
# prompt += "Bottom-left, Standing in front of a cave entrance shimmering with colorful crystals, the boy raises a hand to shield his eyes from the bright glow, his other hand resting on his hip confidently. The surrounding forest is dark, with beams of light breaking through the trees. "
# prompt += "Bottom-middle, Kneeling beside an open wooden chest filled with glittering coins and sparkling gems, the boy claps his hands in delight, his face illuminated by the treasureâ€™s glow. The cave walls are rugged, with faint crystal veins sparkling in the background. "
# prompt += "Bottom-right, Walking back along the glowing forest path at sunset, the boy waves happily over his shoulder at a squirrel perched on a tree stump. The sky is painted with warm oranges and pinks, and the forest glows softly behind him."
